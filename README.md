# MoabDB for Julia

Thank you for your interest in MoabDB's Julia library!

# Big Problem

The current blocking issue is https://github.com/JuliaIO/Parquet.jl/issues/145 AND it can't read Parquets generated by MoabDB

Other options that also won't work are as follows:
- https://expandingman.gitlab.io/Parquet2.jl cannot read from bytes
- https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/547 has no Julia interface

From a high level perspective, the best outcome is a complete Julia interface of Polars
Until the MoabDB team develops an alternative or the JuliaIO team fixes this, please use our Python or Rust library.
Contributions are open under our GitHub repo, sorry for the inconvenience.

# Meanwhile
This library will use PyCall to use Panda's parser and then convert it to Julia's dataframe type.
This is an awful workaround, and we hope a fix is developed soon.
